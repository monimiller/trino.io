As the [Trino Summit 2022 recap post series]({% post_url
2022-11-21-trino-summit-2022-recap %}) continues on, I have been reading all the
wonderful posts by our awesome speakers, facilitated by the Trino developer
relations team. Because I have a perpetual fear of missing out, I convinced them
that I should get in on the fun. For this latest installment in the series, I
will be recapping my very own Trino Summit talk. Basically, I'm ripping off
Bo Burnham's comedy bit where he [reacts to his own reaction video](https://youtu.be/FZVMB8mrNO0?t=35),
blog style.

In this session, I demonstrate building a data lakehouse architecture with
[Starburst Galaxy](https://www.starburst.io/platform/starburst-galaxy/), the
fastest and easiest way to get up running with Trino.
Before I dive into the recap, I want to thank the Trino community for showing
up. I am grateful that I was able to meet and learn from so many members of the
community in person.

## Recap

The premise of this example is that we have Pok√©mon Go data being ingested into
S3, which contains each Pok√©mon's encounter information. This includes the
geo-location data of where each Pok√©mon spawned, and how long the Pok√©mon could
be found at that location. What we don‚Äôt have is any
information on that Pokemon‚Äôs abilities. That information is contained in the
Pok√©dex stored in MongoDB which I‚Äôve cleverly nicknamed **Pok√©MongoDB**. It
includes data about all the Pok√©mon including type, legendary status,
catch rate, and more. To create meaningful insights from our data, we need
to combine the incoming geo-location data with the static dimension CSV table
located in MongoDB.

To do this, I build out a reporting structure in the data lake using
Starburst Galaxy. The first step is to read the raw data stored in the land
layer, then clean and optimize that data into more performant ORC files in the
structure layer. Finally, I join the spawn data and Pok√©dex data together into a
single table that is cleaned and ready to be utilized by a data consumer.
Next I apply role-based access control capabilities within Starburst
Galaxy, which provides the proper data governance so that data consumers only
have read permissions to that final table. I then create some visualizations to
analyze which Pok√©mon are common to spawn in the San Francisco area.

I walk through all the setup required to put this data lakehouse architecture
into action including creating my catalogs, cluster, schemas, and tables. After
incorporating open table formats, applying native security, and building
out a reporting structure, I have confidence that my data lakehouse is built
to last, and end up with some really cool final Pok√©mon graphs.
